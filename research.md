My research and linguistic interests operate at the intersection of theoretical linguistics, computer science, and psychology. Broadly speaking, I investigate the factors that influence how humans process sentences by using experimental designs and computational modelling techniques.

### Semantic ambiguity on wh-scope
I study the relationship between many different linguistic factors such as syntactic positions, morphological markers, and intonation with regard to wh-scope in Korean (Seoul Korean, Kyeongsang Korean), Mandarin, and Persian.
